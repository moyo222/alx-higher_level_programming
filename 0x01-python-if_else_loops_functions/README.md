# Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I used conditionals and loops in Python by using `if`,
`if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and
`for` loops. I practiced writing python functions while learning about
variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
